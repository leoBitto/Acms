#####IDEA:: make CSS model concrete and make it point to 
            the single component, many components can then 
            point to the set of CSS properties that return 
            a string of classes created with the parameters
            set. this allow components that dont need CSS 
            properties to be easily set. 
            as it is for now its not too messy

###########################################################
### How to ################################################
###########################################################

#create a new page
    1. create a page object
    2. create a row object pointing to the name 
        page

#create a journal like page
    1. create the articles, divided in paragraphs
    2. insert the content text created in two 
        containers
    3. set containers to a section and make its
        direction to row


##########################################################
######### Apps.py ########################################
##########################################################

apps.py contain app configuration, it is called two times 
in Acms the ready method is overridden to create urls in 
urlpatterns list (contained in urls.py) dinamically looking 
at the pages contained in the db. 
since this is a config file is runned at the runserver 
command; in the ready method we import all we need to use
it is done there so we are sure everything is loaded 


##########################################################
############## Models ####################################
##########################################################

#NB# to implement a one to many relationship in django the 
    MANY have to point to the one, its not possible for the
    ONE to have a list of the many

components          Overlay
components/navbar   Navbar

##CSS
    is an ABSTRACT class containing all the parameters that
    bootstrap allow you to control, 
    the parameters 

##Flex
    is another ABSTRACT class that let you to control the 
    parameters that bootstrap allow you to set.

##Page
    the page model, every page contains a certain number
    of sections, every page CAN point to a navbar and a 
    footer in order to insert it in the page, this allows 
    you to create particular pages in the site like landing 
    pages or 404 pages

##Section
    every section group every other layout block
    wether it is a grid(row+cols) or a goups of
    container etc...
    the sections can be ordered
    ALL THE SECTIONS ARE STACKED VERTICALLY
    AND SPAN THE ENTIRE VIEW-WIDTH AND VIEW-HEIGHT 
    the sections contain groups of container to avoid using
    rows and columns that display containers orizontaly 
    and vertically respectively while the section can 
    have content both vertical and orizontal. 
    WE SHOULD AIM TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF SectionS PER PAGE

##Container 
    allow to group content wether it is text, images, 
    videos, canvas, etc..
    containers can be used like thumbnails or 
    stacked orizontally to create two "columns" 
    containing a series of content stacked vertically
    obtaining a "mosaic grid"
    otherway to insert a proper grid :

##Grid
    it is a class created to be pointed by rows and cols
    it organize the content to facilitate the display


##Navbar
    

##CONTENTS
###Text
    text objects contains metadata about the text like 
    the data they were created, the author etc
    text can point both to a container and to a col
    so it can be displayed in two different part of the site


###Image
    can point both to a container and to a col
    so it can be displayed in two different part of the site


############################################################
############## Admin #######################################
############################################################
every object is rapresented in admin panel apart for 
abstract objects like CSS and Flex.
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/admin/
the attributes of the admin objects that are set are:
THEY ALL ACCEPT TUPLES OF N ELEMENTS
    -list_display:  used to list the parameters in columns
                    of the list of the objects of the model
                    for types of values can be used in the
                    tuple:
                    1. name of a model field
                    2. a function defined in the model with the
                        decorator '@admin.display()', the function
                        act on the obj passed as a parameter.
                    3. a string created by a function like before
                        with the obj ModelAdmin properties
                    4. a string created by a function like before
                        with the self parameter indicating the model
                        itself so having acce to all of its parameters
                    5. the decorator can be use also with @property

    -fields    :  it refers to the form used to create an
                object, it include a series of 
                attributes. if this is not defined ALL 
                attributes are listed. this option should 
                not be confused with the 'fields' 
                dictionary key in the 'fieldsets' option

    -fieldsets :  it control the layout of admin 'add' and
                'change' pages, the forms used to create 
                objects. it is a tuple of tuples. 
                In each internal tuple a string is the 
                first element, its the title of the group
                of attributes, while the second element of
                the tuple is a dictionary of:
                =classes : used to define behavior, ACCEPT
                            a tuple of string elements. to
                            collapse the options:
                            ('collapse',)
                            or to give it extra space:
                            ('wide')
                            these are CSS classes applied to
                            the fieldset
                =fields  : its a tuple containing more
                            attributes that can be set
                            it is like using the fields
                            explained before.
                =description:is a string containing extra text 
                            displayed a the to of each fieldset
                            it can contain HTML elements

############################################################
############## Views #######################################
############################################################
views are used to serve the base.html and populate with the 
data, passed as context dict, from the Page object requested

in views WILL BE implemented all the api functions that 
allow to look for specific piece of content, modify it, and
store new content. 
TO BE DECIDED:
will this API be available only to custom admin implemented
through auth native of django or not

############### Urls #######################################
############################################################

urls are handled thanks to three overridden methods, 

the first is defined when the application start, it is a 
method called 'ready()' defined in the apps.py file, it scan all
objects Page in the db and add them in the urlpatterns list
defined in urls.py

the second method is 'save()' and is overridden in the model of
Page in the file pages.py in the models folder, it takes the 
name and the url of the page and update the urlpatterns list
then call the save method of the parent class.

finally the third is the override of the delete method of the
Page object, it takes the list compare the name of the URLPattern
objects stored in urlpatterns and the url of the object deleted
the it delete the URLPattern object from the list and call the
super.delete() method
